#Instructions:
This file includes all the code for the assignment.
The code has already been run, and all outputs are displayed.

However, if running is needed, then all what needs to be done is:
1. MAKE SURE THE DATASETS FOLDER "ml-100k" IS ADDED WITHIN THE ZIP FOLDER OR DIRECTORY

2. INSIDE THE NOTEBOOK FILE, FROM THE NAVIGATION BAR (main Menu), GO TO KERNEL -> RESTART & RUN ALL.

3. ALL OUTPUTS WILL BE DISPLAYED


 
The zip file contains 4 files
1- Assignment3.ipynb
2- readme.md
3- the data folder (ml-100k).
4- the pdf file that contains the actual solution that was implemented.
